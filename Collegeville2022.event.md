### The College Workshop Series on Scientific Software

The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry and laboratories.  While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop in 2019 focused on software sustainability.  The 2020 workshop focused on developer productivity.  In 2021 we focused on software teams.  Collegeville 2022 will focus on software design.

### Resources from Collegeville 2021

Recordings and other artifacts from last year's workshop are available at the [Collegeville 2021 website](https://collegeville.github.io/CW21/Resources.html)

### Contribute to Collegeville 2022

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving scientific software design is encouraged to submit content to build the program of Collegeville 2022: https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/Contribute.  Questions can be sent to Mike Heroux <mheroux@csbsju.edu>.

We welcome the following contributions:

| Contribution| Submission Date | Description                                |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| White paper | June 24 | A brief document articulating impediments, challenges, opportunities or potential solutions in the design of scientific software. Whitepapers should be registered with Zenodo to obtain a DOI.  Then submit your DOI as instructed on the [Contribute](Contribute.md) page. <br> **Note:** We have arranged for select authors of white papers to expand their paper as a peer-reviewed article for a special issue of [_Computing in Science and Engineering (CiSE)_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs).  Details available soon.|
| Recorded presentation | June 24 - July 15 | We will accept short recorded presentations on content selected from some of the submitted white papers. If your white paper content would make a good presentation for the workshop, we will contact you to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. |
| Teatime theme | July 15 |A topic related to software design for open discussion during teatime. If your teatime theme is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion on the theme during the July 20 – 22 workshop. |
| Poster        | July 15  |A PDF or interactive webpage that will be the focus of small group discussion during teatime. If your poster is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion during the July 20 – 22 workshop.   |
| Watch party | July 15 - 22 | Participants can host a watch party for one or more of the workshop video recordings. Given the increasing number of recorded and available talks online, these watch parties can become regular occasions for sharing recent research and ideas, much like a reading group. More information on watch parties and their post-workshop sustenance is available on [this page](WorkshopResources/WatchParty/WatchPartyList.md). |
| Panelists & Keynote |  July 26 - 28 | During the workshop dates of July 26 – 28, we will host a live keynote and plenary panel discussions with Q&A as the first events each day.  We are limited to just a few panelists and one keynote each day and will invite people based on their white paper submission and the diversity of viewpoint for the theme of the day.  We will contact panelist and keynote candidates to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. The panel and keynote sessions will be recorded and available after the workshop. |
